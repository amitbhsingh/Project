Project Proposal: ​ Short Term Price Prediction
# Background
Regression problem dealing with predictive modeling of digital asset price time series. Use financial indicators


and other relevant features to predict price at a fixed time interval in the future.
# Objectives
● Develop a predictive model for price of one of the major digital asset pairs\
● Experiment with various classical or deep learning ML models\
● Create a structured ML/Data Science project workflow
Dataset\
● One year worth of 1-hour candles (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) Timeframe\
● To predict if the price will go up or down compared to the current price


# Phase One  Start and End Date: 
- Literature review & Exploratory statistics 
- Basic plotting and data visualization
# Phase Two Start and End Date:
- Feature engineering
- Continue plotting and data visualization
# Phase Three Start and End Date:
- Implement & test models
# Phase Four Start and End Date:
- Final optimizations
# Phase Five Start and End Date:
- Develop basic report of results and relevance to business value
# Key Stakeholders
TBD: Data Scientist
Amit Shavit: Product Manager/Mentor

Vlad Arialin / Vincent Haeger:

Assist with research, data structuring and feature engineering

Weekly or bi-weekly update meetings will be arranged with Consilium management and the student team. These meetings will cover progress made towards the goals outlined above, as well as attempt to address any major roadblocks the student is facing. Senior technical staff from Consilium will be made available upon request, barring any other major developments that week. Meetings may take place remotely or in-person.
