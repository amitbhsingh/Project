# Project README: Time Series Analysis and Prediction Using XGBoost and Other Models

## Overview

This project focuses on time series analysis and prediction using various machine learning models, with an emphasis on XGBoost. The primary data source is a cryptocurrency dataset from Binance, featuring hourly price changes of Binance Coin (BNB) against Bitcoin (BTC). The project is divided into multiple phases, including literature review, data exploration, feature engineering, and modeling. Advanced techniques like tsfresh for feature extraction and different machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, and XGBoost are utilized.

## Project Layout

### Literature Review
- Researching medium blogs and related work done by others in the field.
- Summarization of findings is available in the repository.

### Phase 1: Data Exploration
- Basic data exploration to understand the dataset's dimensions.
- Initial plotting and analysis using Python libraries like Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Bokeh.

### Phase 2: Feature Engineering
- Utilization of `tsfresh` for advanced feature engineering, extracting around 800 statistically significant features.
- Analysis of feature importance, percent change, moving average, and daily return calculations.

### Phase 3: Modeling
- Implementation of baseline models including Logistic Regression and Stochastic Gradient Descent.
- Extensive use of XGBoost for improved predictive accuracy.

## Key Files and Notebooks

1. `bnb_btc_1H_binance.csv` - Primary dataset file.
2. `Feature Engineering and Analysis.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook detailing the feature engineering process.
3. `Modeling and Prediction.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook with model implementations and evaluations.

## Analysis and Results

- Extensive data analysis using various statistical and machine learning techniques.
- Comparison of model performances with a focus on XGBoost due to its efficiency and accuracy in handling large datasets and complex feature sets.

## Challenges and Learnings

- Handling a large number of features generated by `tsfresh`.
- Balancing the trade-offs between model complexity and performance.

## Feedback and Improvements

The project presents a comprehensive approach to time series analysis with well-structured phases. The utilization of `tsfresh` for feature engineering is commendable as it allows for an in-depth analysis of time series data. However, the project could benefit from the following improvements:

1. **Model Optimization**: Tuning hyperparameters of the models, especially XGBoost, to enhance performance.
2. **Feature Selection**: While tsfresh provides extensive features, implementing feature selection techniques to reduce dimensionality might improve model performance.
3. **Evaluation Metrics**: Exploring additional evaluation metrics beyond accuracy, such as F1-score or AUC-ROC, for a more holistic model assessment.
4. **Cross-validation**: Implementing cross-validation techniques to ensure model robustness and avoid overfitting.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: A more detailed comparison between different models would provide clearer insights into their relative strengths and weaknesses.

## Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates the use of advanced techniques in time series analysis and machine learning, providing a solid foundation for predictive modeling in financial datasets. With some enhancements, especially in model optimization and feature selection, the project's efficacy in predicting time series data can be further improved.
